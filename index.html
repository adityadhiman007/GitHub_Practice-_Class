          In 1819, Millworker William Collins from Scotland ,set up a company for printing and pulishing pamphlets ,sermons, hymn books and prayer books. That company was Collins and was to mark the birth of HarperCollins Publishers as we known it today 
          The long tradition of Collins dictionary publishing can be traced back to the first dictionary WEilliam published in 1824,
          Greek and English Lexicon. Indeed ,from 1840 onwards, he began to produce 
          illustrated dictionaries and even obtained licence to print and publish the Bible.
